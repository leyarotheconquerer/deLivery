# Ludum Dare 53

Theme: **Delivery**

## de-Livery

Concept:
* Sway an entire city to your family's influence
* Choose your livery (name, emblem, and colors)
* Start with your family's dwellings
* Spread influence to the surrounding buildings until you control the entire city

Mechanics:
* Each building has an influence meter
* Influence spreads around the building in which you place your influence point
* Each building has an effect
	- Houses add to your total influence
	- Taverns increase the rate at which your influence spreads
	- Cathedarals give you another influence point
	- Constabularies give you defense against other influence
	- Guilds allow you to build a single building (extending your influence to new quarters of the city)
* Capture the entire city to win

Coolness:
* Design your own livery
* Area mechanics
* Growing a machine of influence

Difficulties:
* Custom livery
* Scaling up ticks
* Difficulty scaling well
* Generating maps
* Convincing people that the game conforms to the theme :)
