de-Livery

Build your town to control the country-side

Certain buildings give you certain buffs to spread your influence more quickly
Capture existing villages/towns/buildings to get buffs
Spend your influence to gain more influence

Watch out for other houses as they expand their influence
They may send out vandals to disrupt your businesses and vandalize them
Make sure you have town guard to defend your buildings

Types of buildings
Constabulary - defends buildings from vandalism
Cathedral - increases influence generation
House - builds up influence capacity
Tavern - increases influence

Influence visualized on map as your color banners and patterns painted on buildings
Allow player to design/choose their own Livery at the beginning (colors and logo preferrably)

Pros:

* Interesting concept
* Not standard theme interpretation
* Customization

Cons:

* Uncertain technical hurdle of painting and using image
* Difficult to balance
* Unclear how enemies should scale
* How does vandalism work?
* How do you prevent the player from being overwhelmed

Cat Burglar

You're a cat
Your human has been getting some suspicious packages recently
Time to figure out what's going on.

Sneak past the watchful eye of the humans around the room
Crawl under the couch
Behind the plant
Across the conveniently placed planks

Recharge your dash with whatever catnip you can find

Claw open the delivery to discover what it is

Pros:

* Funny
* Simple concept
* Execution will be complex, doable, but stretching

Cons:

* Animating a cat
* Figuring out a way to scale challenge
* Implementing stealth mechanics

Joe's Traders

Joe has hired you to protect his deliveries
He has a lot of fruit and vegetables to ship to alpha centauri
Unfortunately a bunch of space pirates have decided to raid the convoy
	(something about scurvy being intolerable)

You have been hired to set up defenses around the convoy

Build your space stations around the planets to ward off pirates
Ships will travel from planet to planet in the solar system
Pirates will be attracted to ships in the various gravity wells

Build stations at each planet to ensure that pirates don't overwhelm the convoy

You'll get more money to build more defenses as deliveries make their way to alpha centauri

At first you'll only be responsible for defenses around earth.
As the pirate threat grows, you'll need to expand to the other planets

Pros:

* Clear concept
* Cool usage of planets and obvious scaling by adding planets
* Spaceshipts

Cons:

* Kinda generic
* Explosions and weapon types could be difficult
* Making it interesting isn't obvious
